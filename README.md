## Bot Types

- `spot` - Spot trading bot

### Spot Trading Bot

The spot trading bot is a simple market maker bot that trades on the spot market.

It works by listening for new orders on the market and placing a counter-order to buy at a slightly higher price or sell at a slightly lower price depending on your configured profit margin.

### Earn Bot

The earn bot is a bot that automatically reinvests your earnings from staking and lending.

It currently only works if you have existing positions in the staking or lending products.
